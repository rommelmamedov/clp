# Proposal for React component library for Thrive Design System

## Available Options

There are several popular React component libraries that are widely used by developers. However, it's important to consider specific project requirements and evaluate whether any of these component library ecosystem meets our needs.

**Main 3 options in my opinion we need to consider:**

Mantine, Ant Design and MaterialUI are all popular UI component libraries that provide pre-built components and styles for building user interfaces in web applications. Each library has its own unique features and design principles, so the choice between them depends on our specific requirements and preferences.

---

[Mantine](http://mantine.dev/) is a modern library focused on providing an excellent user and developer experience. Development began in January 2021, and the 1.0 version was published on May 3rd, 2021. Since then, it has seen over 100 releases.

**Key Features:**

- **Performance and Accessibility**: Mantine emphasizes performance and accessibility. Its smaller bundle size compared to other libraries can lead to faster loading times. It offers a set of components and hooks for building responsive and accessible interfaces.
- **TypeScript Support**: It provides TypeScript support out of the box, which can be beneficial for type-safe development.
- **[Components](https://mantine.dev/core/button/)**: the core components library is extensive and includes niche components like color pickers, date-range pickers, and timelines. With over 100 different components, you'll rarely need to create your own. Each component supports style overriding for internal elements with classes or inline styles.
- **[Theming & Customization](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/)**: It has a clean and customizable design, allowing you to tweak the styles to fit your project's needs. Mantine's theming is an object that you can subscribe to from anywhere using context and extend with any number of additional colors, fonts, shadows, and so on. All components support both light and dark themes out of the box.
- **[Documentation & Support](https://mantine.dev/pages/about/)**: Mantine is built and maintained by Vitaly Rtishchev and over 150 other contributors. Most new features and components/hooks are added to the library based on feedback from the community. You can participate in new features discussions on [GitHub](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wbH82zuWMN). The documentation is comprehensive, covering everything from basic usage to advanced topics, with plenty of examples and tutorials to help you get started.
